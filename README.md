# Power BI Dashboard - Global Terrorism Trends
# Project Overview
This project is part of Task 1 assigned by my carrier intern. It involves creating an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into global terrorism trends using the Terrorism Database. The dataset includes detailed information such as attack dates, locations, types, weapons used, casualties, and responsible groups. The goal of the project is to offer a comprehensive and visually engaging overview of terrorism activities worldwide, helping users identify trends and patterns in terrorist incidents.

# Features
Global Map Visualization: Displays terrorism incidents across the world with geographical breakdowns by countries and regions.
Attack Type Breakdown: Provides detailed analysis of the different types of attacks (e.g., bombings, armed assaults, hijackings, etc.).
Casualty Statistics: Summarizes the number of casualties (fatalities and injuries) across different attacks.
Weapon Type Analysis: Shows the types of weapons used in various incidents.
Yearly Trends: Tracks the number of terrorist incidents over the years to identify patterns.
Responsible Groups: Highlights terrorist groups involved in different attacks.
# Dataset
The Terrorism Database contains detailed records of terrorist attacks worldwide. Each entry includes:

Date of the incident
Location (country, region, city)
Attack Type (bombing, armed assault, etc.)
Weapons Used
Number of Casualties (fatalities and injuries)
Responsible Group (if known)
# Dashboard Insights
A clear view of the most affected regions and countries.
Year-on-year trends to analyze the rise or fall in terrorist incidents.
Breakdown of attack types and the methods used, including weapon preferences.
Identification of key groups responsible for major incidents.
# Tools and Technologies
Power BI: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Terrorism Database: Dataset containing historical information about terrorist attacks.
# How to Use
Open the dashboard in Power BI.
Use the filters provided to view data specific to a region, year, or attack type.
Explore the different visualizations (maps, bar charts, and pie charts) to understand the trends in terrorism activities.
You can drill down into specific data points for more detailed insights (e.g., click on a country to see specific incidents).
# Project Files
Power BI Dashboard (.pbix): The main file for the dashboard.
Terrorism Dataset (.csv): The raw data used for this project.
# Future Enhancements
Add a time-lapse visualization to show the spread of terrorism incidents over the years.
Incorporate predictive analytics to forecast future terrorism trends.
Include more advanced drill-through capabilities to view detailed reports by country or region.
# Conclusion
This project was a great opportunity to apply data visualization techniques to real-world data. The insights drawn from this dashboard can serve as valuable resources for policymakers, researchers, and the general public to understand the dynamics of global terrorism.
